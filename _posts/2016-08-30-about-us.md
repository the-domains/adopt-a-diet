Thanks for viewing our simple site.

We thought of Adopt a Diet when were watching BBC's series The Toughest Place To Be A... . In the episode we were watching a London bus driver lived and worked with a bus driver in Jakarta, Indonesia, for a few weeks. It was amazing to see the generosity of the bus driver on his return to London---he was on a mission to raise money to support the family he had been staying with and to help them escape from poverty.

We had the idea that adopting the basic diet of another country, would not only help us to associate with them and break us out our cycles of greed and entitlement, but it would also be a way of freeing up money that we could give to help others.

The recipes and meal plans are not meant to be completely authentic---we've tried hard to recreate the basic diet of another place, but another main aim is to keep things cheap and simple. If you're trying the recipes and have suggestions of alternative ingredients that are cheap and simple in your country, then please let us know and we'll adapt the recipes as we go.

If you have suggestions of charities or recipes that we can consider adding to our repertoire then please get in touch:
